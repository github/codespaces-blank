### **Description** ###
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).   
Example 1:
```
Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

### **Solution 1** ###
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & mask) == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### **Solution 2** ###
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & mask) != 0) {
                count++;
            }
            mask <<= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### **Solution 3** ###
In the binary representation, the least significant 1-bit in nn always corresponds to a 0-bit in n - 1. Therefore, anding the two numbers nn and n - 1 always flips the least significant 1-bit in n to 0, and keeps all other bits the same.

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count++;
            n = n & (n - 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
