### **Description** ###
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```

### **Solution** ###
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/discuss/132479/Simple-explanation-on-how-to-arrive-at-the-solution  
There's lot of answers here, but none of them shows how they arrived at the answer, here's my simple try to explain.

Eg: Let's try this with our hand 3 + 2 = 5 , the carry will be with in the brackets i.e "()"
```
3 => 011 
2=>  010
     ____
     1(1)01
```
Here we will forward the carry at the second bit to get the result.
So which bitwise operator can do this ? A simple observation says that XOR can do that,but it just falls short in dealing with the carry properly, but correctly adds when there is no need to deal with carry.
For Eg:
```
1   =>  001 
2   =>  010 
1^2 =>  011 (2+1 = 3) 
```
So now when we have carry, to deal with, we can see the result as :
```
3  => 011 
2  => 010 
3^2=> 001  
```
Here we can see XOR just fell short with the carry generated at the second bit.
So how can we find the carry ? The carry is generated when both the bits are set, i.e (1,1) will generate carry but (0,1 or 1,0 or 0,0) won't generate a carry, so which bitwise operator can do that ? AND gate ofcourse.

To find the carry we can do
```
3    =>  011 
2    =>  010 
3&2  =>  010
```
now we need to add it to the previous value we generated i.e ( 3 ^ 2), but the carry should be added to the left bit of the one which genereated it.
so we left shift it by one so that it gets added at the right spot.

Hence (3&2)<<1 => 100
so we can now do
```
3 ^2        =>  001 
(3&2)<<1    =>  100 

Now xor them, which will give 101(5) , we can continue this until the carry becomes zero.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        int carry;
        do {
            carry = (a & b);
            a = a ^ b;
            b = carry << 1;
        } while (b != 0);
        return a;
    }
}
```
