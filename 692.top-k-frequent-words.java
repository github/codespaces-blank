 * Testcase Example:  '["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"]\n2'
 *
 * Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.
 * Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two
 * words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical
 * order comes first.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
 * Output: ["i", "love"]
 * Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
 * ⁠   Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is",
 * "is"], k = 4
 * Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
 * Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent
 * words,
 * ⁠   with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
 * Input words contain only lowercase letters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space.
