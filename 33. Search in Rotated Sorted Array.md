### **Description** ###
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

### **Solution 1** ###
The idea is that when rotating the array, there must be one half of the array that is still in sorted order.
For example, 6 7 1 2 3 4 5, the order is disrupted from the point between 7 and 1. So when doing binary search, we can make a judgement that which part is ordered and whether the target is in that range, if yes, continue the search in that half, if not continue in the other half.
```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            
            if (nums[start] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (target < nums[mid] && target >= nums[start]) {
                    end = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            
            if (nums[mid] <= nums[end]) {
                if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end]) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
