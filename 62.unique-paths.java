 *
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in
 * the diagram below).
 * 
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
 * is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in
 * the diagram below).
 * 
 * How many possible unique paths are there?
 * 
 * 
 * Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
 * 
 * Note: m and n will be at most 100.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: m = 3, n = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the
 * bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Right -> Down
 * 2. Right -> Down -> Right
 * 3. Down -> Right -> Right
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: m = 7, n = 3
 * Output: 28
